# Parameterized Component Storage
Cups/boxes/drawers for storing small components within a larger box. Totally parameterized to fit any (rectangular) situation.

## Goal
- Provide a universal solution for storing arbitrarily sized components in arbitrarily sized boxes

## Background
I have a lot of tools, electronic components, and mechanical parts to store, but I don't want to buy a bunch of dedicated containers when I'm already drowing in boxes from 3D printer filament and Amazon packages. In the spirit of reducing, reusing, and recycling, made these little cups to store my things more efficiently without generating more waste.
